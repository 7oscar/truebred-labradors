Hello and welcome to Truebred Labradors **Labrador breeders NSW Australia** webpage.

Truebred Labradors are **registered Labrador breeders** in NSW Australia. They are members of _Dogs NSW_ and the _Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC)_.

### GENERAL

Also, we have been Labrador breeders in NSW Australia since 1997 and mostly offer both black Labradors for sale and yellow Labradors for sale. Puppies normally leave our kennel and go to their new families from when they are at least eight weeks of age.

Before we provide a few more details about our puppies, we want to clarify that a Labrador Retriever is the correct and proper name for a Labrador. It is NOT a crossbreed between a Labrador and a Golden Retriever. We receive several emails about this and just wanted to clarify.

### TOP 7 THINGS YOU SHOULD GET FROM YOUR LABRADOR BREEDER

There are 7 things that I believe that you should be able to get, if you wish, from any Labrador breeder in NSW Australia. These include:

* hip-score test results for both puppy parents (should be below about 12);
* elbow test results for both puppy parents (should be below 3);
* PRA test results for both puppy parents (neither parent should be AFFECTED);
* EIC test results for both puppy parents (neither parent should be AFFECTED);
* pedigrees for both puppy parents (should be registered with ANKC;
* the current vaccination certificate for your Labrador puppy (should be current and have at-least a C3 vaccination which is for three diseases); and
* the microchip registration transfer form (which should have correct microchip number included).

Obviously, some of these will not be available until after the purchase of a puppy (e.g. puppy pedigree papers).

We also offer a a customer satisfaction guarantee so that if within 3 days the puppy is not acceptable to you **for any reason**, then we take the puppy back and refund 50% of the purchase price.

### Current Labrador Puppies

Our [Labrador Puppy Update page](https://labradors.id.au/puppy-update/ "labrador puppy update page") will normally have details of puppies available, and our next litter is expected. We try and post updates often.

Most of our Labrador puppies go to their new families in the Sydney, Newcastle, and Central Coast regions, with some going to the Mid North Coast and Far North coast regions. Some pups also go to homes throughout NSW and also interstate. Transport can be arranged if desired. This can include by road and/or by air. More details, including costs, for example, are available on our [Labrador puppies for sale NSW page.](https://labradors.id.au/labrador-puppies-for-sale-in-nsw-australia/ "labrador puppies for sale nsw australia")

There are a few Labrador health problems that are at higher risk with some puppies or from some breeders. Our puppy parents or breeding stock are tested and screened for various possible hereditary or genetic health issues. These include (for example) hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, Exercise Induced Collapse (EIC), Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis (HNPK),and Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). By ensuring that at least one parent is reported as being CLEAR for the conditions tested by DNA (i.e. EIC, HNPK, and EIC), I can then be assured that no puppies will be affected by any of the conditions.

Details of reviews from some of our happy puppy owners are also available. [Check out some of our reviews.](https://labradors.id.au/about-us/reviews/ "Truebred Labradors registered Labrador breeders reviews")

Also, we have a number of [Labrador puppy videos here for you.](https://labradors.id.au/videos/ "labrador puppy videos")

If you are looking for cheap labradors for sale then we feel that this can be a 'false economy', as what you may save in the purchase price may be exceeded later on with health problems or associated Veterinarian fees. In addition to the stress etc. to the puppy owners, puppy, etc.

We hope that the above details and our website are helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact us if any further details etc. are required in relation to our Labrador Retrievers.

### CHOCOLATE LABRADOR'S BEHAVIOUR

There is some interesting research about the behaviour of Labrador Retrievers, and the difference in behaviour with the different colours, especially chocolate. If you would like to learn more, then please check out my short [article about chocolate Labrador's behaviour](https://labradors.id.au/chocolate-labradors-temperament-and-behaviour/ "Chocolate Labrador's behaviour").

The Lab pups that I breed are mainly black or yellow.

### LABS WITH LIGHT COLOURED NOSES - SUNBURN OR CANCER RISKS?

Labradors (or any dog) with light coloured noses may be at a higher risk of sunburn and/or cancer. This is related to their loss of pigment. It can also occur in places other than their nose. Here is a short article about [Labs with light coloured noses - sunburn and/or cancer risks](https://labradors.id.au/labs-light-coloured-noses-sunburn-cancer-risks/ "Labs with light coloured noses - sunburn and/or cancer risks?").

The Labrador pups that I breed normally have noses with plenty of pigment, and are generally dark and/or black.

### Truebred Labradors registered Labrador breeders

Please note that our registered breeder kennel name is Truebred. Another Labrador breeder in NSW has used 'Truebred Labradors registered Labrador breeders' on their website. They have been asked to remove this, so they have changed it to 'true bred labrador retrievers'. So please be aware.

Apparently, Oscar Wilde said that _"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness."_ So I suppose it is flattering! :D

### BRIEF Q & A:

#### Q: HOW TO BE A LABRADOR BREEDER?

A: If you want to be a registered Labrador breeder say in NSW, then you need to join or register with _Dogs NSW_. As a registered Labrador breeder you can breed purebred puppies with registered pedigree papers. '

States other than NSW each have their own state organisation. 'For example, in NSW, it is Dogs NSW. In WA it is Dogs West, etc. The rules for each association may vary. State organisations are members of the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC). The ANKC also set rules that apply to the State organisations and also the registered Labrador or dog breeders.

Please be aware that in recent years more organisations have started that allow people to register as breeders. And some members of these organisations seem to also now be advertising as 'registered breeders'. I believe that there is a big difference between the standard of breeding and the puppies being produced by some of these breeders compared to breeders who are registered with the ANKC and its State bodies. So, if a breeder is advertising as being a registered breeder, I would be asking to see or confirm the details of their registration. Breeders registered with the ANKC or its State bodies will have a registration number (e.g. my number is 2000923650). If in doubt, you can contact the relevant State body to confirm registration. [Further details of the State bodies are available here.](https://labradors.id.au/australian-labrador-breeders/ "State bodies")

If you want more details about how to become a registered breeder in NSW then please visit [Dogs NSW webpage](https://www.dogsnsw.org.au/breeding/how-to-become-a-breeder.html "Dogs NSW webpage").

#### Q: QUESTIONS TO ASK A LABRADOR BREEDER?

A: For me, I would be asking what are the puppy parents hip scores and elbow scores. I would also be wanting to know if the puppies are or could be 'affected' by conditions such as Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis (HNPK), or Exercise-Induce Collapse (EIC). I would accept 'clear' and 'carrier' but not 'affected'. Ideally, get a copy of these test results.
